# ðŸ”§ Vercel Authentication Fix

## Problem Solved
Login worked locally but failed to redirect on Vercel deployment. Users got stuck on login page despite successful authentication.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **Manual redirect handling** instead of using NextAuth's built-in redirect
2. **Timing issues** with JWT token creation and middleware execution
3. **Environment differences** between local and production

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed useAuth Hook
- Changed `redirect: false` to `redirect: true` in signIn call
- Removed manual setTimeout and router.push logic
- Let NextAuth handle redirects automatically

### 2. Enhanced Middleware
- Added `secureCookie: true` for production
- Improved token retrieval error handling
- Better logging for debugging

### 3. Improved Dashboard Routing
- Added fallback mechanisms
- Better role-based routing
- Enhanced error handling

## Required Vercel Environment Variables

**CRITICAL - Set these in Vercel Dashboard:**

```bash
# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app

# Database (Supabase)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.PROJECT_REF:PASSWORD@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@db.PROJECT_REF.supabase.co:5432/postgres

# OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# Build optimization
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true
```

## How to Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET

Run locally:
```bash
npx auth secret
```

Copy the output to Vercel environment variables.

## Testing the Fix

1. Deploy to Vercel with correct environment variables
2. Try logging in with credentials
3. Should redirect automatically to appropriate dashboard based on user role

## Expected Behavior

- **BUYER role**: Redirects to `/` (home page)
- **ORGANIZER role**: Redirects to `/organizer/{userId}/dashboard`
- **ADMIN role**: Redirects to `/admin/dashboard`

## Debugging

Check Vercel function logs for:
- `[NextAuth] Redirect callback called`
- `[AuthMiddleware] Token result`
- `[Dashboard] Page accessed`

If issues persist, check that NEXTAUTH_URL matches your exact Vercel domain.
