# Middleware Optimization Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Removed Redirect Loops**
- Eliminated multiple middleware functions that could cause circular redirects
- Simplified logic to prevent authenticated users from being redirected from public routes

### 2. **Reduced Token Fetching**
- Token is now fetched only once per request instead of multiple times
- Added proper error handling for token fetching failures

### 3. **Optimized Matcher Configuration**
- Updated matcher to exclude static files, API routes, and other resources that don't need middleware processing
- This reduces the number of middleware executions significantly

### 4. **Simplified Logic Flow**
- Removed complex nested middleware calls
- Single middleware function handles all routing logic
- Faster execution path

### 5. **Better Error Handling**
- Added try-catch blocks to prevent middleware crashes
- Graceful fallbacks when token fetching fails

## Performance Improvements Expected:

1. **Faster Login**: No more extra session fetches or redirect loops
2. **Reduced Server Load**: Fewer middleware executions on static resources
3. **Better UX**: Immediate redirects without buffering
4. **Stable Routing**: Consistent behavior across different user roles

## Key Changes Made:

- Simplified `middleware.ts` from ~300 lines to ~60 lines
- Removed `authMiddleware`, `roleMiddleware`, `publicMiddleware` functions
- Optimized matcher to exclude unnecessary routes
- Added `/dashboard` route handler for proper role-based redirects
- Improved error handling and logging

## Testing Recommendations:

1. Test login as organizer - should be much faster now
2. Check browser network tab for redirect chains
3. Monitor server logs for timing information
4. Verify no infinite redirect loops occur

The middleware is now optimized for Vercel deployment and should resolve the buffering issues you experienced.
